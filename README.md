# To-Do-List

## Simple To-Do List with std::queue

This project is a quick, easy to-do list using the `queue` data structure.

## How it works, and how to use
In summary, this is a to-do list that enables you to both add items and remove items. When you're done with a task, you remove it. When you're not done with it yet, you choose the 'do nothing' option (which will be prompted to you).

- Thee program will first ask you the tasks you want to add. You'll be able to type it, and when you want to put that task in the list, press `Enter`. Itll then ask you again, and you keep putting in your tasks until youre done.
- Press X when you finish, and your list of tasks will be displayed on the screen.
- Following that action, you'll get to remove a task when you are done with it, and it will notify you of the item that has been removed from the top of the task queue.
- Eventually when the list is empty, itll notify you, and you can exit the program by pressing Enter when you can.

## Can you add to this project?
- If you want to use this to-do list for your own personal use, or as part of another project, this is an open source project so you are free to do what you want with it!
